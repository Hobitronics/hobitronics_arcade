# 🐍 Snake Game on OLED with Joystick

## Description:
Bring back the nostalgic arcade vibes with this minimalist Snake Game built using an Arduino, a joystick, and a 0.96" OLED screen.  
Control the snake, eat the food, and grow longer — all in just 64 pixels!

---

## 🎮 Components:
- Arduino UNO  
- 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)  
- Joystick Module (Analog)  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard  
- Optional: 10kΩ resistors (if needed for joystick voltage divider)

---

## 🔍 Features:
- Real-time snake movement using analog joystick input  
- Auto food spawning (never on snake body!)  
- Self and wall collision detection  
- Game over animation and auto-reset  
- Adjustable speed via `moveDelay`  
- Compact and optimized for 128x64 OLED

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:
- OLED graphics with Adafruit GFX library  
- Analog joystick input handling  
- Arrays and game logic on microcontrollers  
- Collision detection  
- Procedural food spawning

👉 [Find Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Hobitronics/hobitronics_arcade/blob/main/code/snake_game.ino)

---

## ✅ Quick Tips:
- If the joystick feels reversed, just swap X/Y pins or logic in `readJoystick()`  
- To increase difficulty, reduce `moveDelay`  
- Expand the project by adding a score counter, splash screen, or level system!

- 5 levels of handcrafted maze puzzles  
- Pixel-perfect joystick navigation (analog input to digital move)  
- Dynamic maze drawing from PROGMEM to save RAM  
- Win animation and auto-restart  
- Button press supported for future upgrades (pause, reset, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:
- Drawing 2D levels using arrays in `PROGMEM`  
- Display graphics with Adafruit GFX & SSD1306  
- Handling analog joystick input and debouncing movement  
- Coordinate-based logic and collision detection  
- Game state logic and level progression

# 🧱 Brick Breaker on OLED  
### Part of the Hobitronics Arcade Collection

---

## 🎮 Game Description  
A full-featured **Brick Breaker** game built using an Arduino UNO, joystick, and 128x64 OLED.  
Use the joystick to control the paddle, bounce the ball, break all the bricks, and advance through 3 exciting levels. Game Over and Victory screens included!

---

## ⚙️ Components Required
- Arduino UNO  
- 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)  
- Analog Joystick Module (connected to A0)  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard  

---

## 🧠 Key Features & Concepts
- Joystick-based paddle control (analog input)  
- OLED rendering with **Adafruit GFX + SSD1306**  
- Ball physics with basic collision detection  
- Brick grid with collision response  
- Game states: win, lose, reset  
- Level progression with increasing difficulty  
- Memory-efficient display updates using `clearDisplay()` and `fillRect()` logic

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics
- **Paddle**: Controlled via joystick (X-axis)  
- **Ball**: Bounces off walls, paddle, and bricks  
- **Bricks**: Destroy on impact, earn points  
- **Levels**:  
  - Level 1 → 2 rows of bricks, slower ball  
  - Level 2 → 3 rows of bricks, medium speed  
  - Level 3 → 4 rows, faster ball  
- **Win**: Clear all bricks in Level 3  
- **Lose**: Ball falls below paddle
